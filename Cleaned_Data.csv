3) How would your device integrate with Radars, Ultrasonic sensors - would the customer be required to do custom installations for all of these (including power to these separate devices)?
4) In my opinion, customers that need these kinds of features would get them when buying the car. A HUD would work better if it already came with the car rather than a third party install. The integration would be better if it came with the car.

Almost everybody has a constantly up-to-date gps unit in their pocket, via their smart phone.

TPMS in passenger vehicles have been a requirement for quite some time now. Unless you're targeting individuals driving a 1995 shitbox, it might be more beneficial to trim the bulk and focus on more useful targets.

The unit you have sketched out is similar to some already on the market. Having a unit that you can add features to is an appealing option. But, I'd be a little afraid the UI could get cluttered. You could wind up toggling through numerous functions, via an add-on controller, just to get where you want to be. That seems like it would be distracting, which negates the benefits of a HUD.

In summation, I think a HUD unit can be massively beneficial. Having a unit that you can add your desired features to is a creative way to avoid clutter from numerous sources while having a single entity to contact if problems arise.

However, it does have a feature that warns me in a non-invasive way (warning light on dash display) when there's not enough stopping distance in front of my car at high speed, which I do like. 

I use android auto on every journey and find it very useful for playing music and controlling it from my car's entertainment system, rather than using an AUX cable and having to control it from the phone, sat nav, and the ability to make/answer calls and texts. It makes driving much safer to be able to control these things without taking my eyes off the road, and use Google assistant to use voice controls. I find reversing cameras unnecessary - the beeping reversing sensors and the car mirrors are sufficient.

The features I'd want the most that aren't included on this list are wingmirrors which automatically fold/unfold on locking the car, and the ability to remotely control the car's air conditioning (for instance using the key or through an app) to be able to cool the car on a hot day, or clear the windscreen on a cold day, without having to sit in the car, or leave it unlocked and potentially at risk of theft.",I will buy a new car with the features I want,"I would consider buying a dashcam if it reduced my insurance premium. I would buy and install this myself, from whichever dealer was the cheapest, as it's not complex to set up.
I have purchased aftermarket reversing sensors - I bought a used car and paid the dealership (a large chain used car dealership) to install sensors before purchase, however I wouldn't buy other add ons from them as they were pricier than other places. I chose them for the sensors as the installation was very involved - it necessitated drilling holes in the bumper for the sensors, etc. and they had the expertise to do this properly.","I think having add-ons is a good idea, especially wireless ones which don't require a lot of fussy installation. I personally wouldn't buy a unit like this as I'm not the biggest fan of HUDs and already have a screen on my entertainment system which I can use for navigation. People able to spend the kind of money this product would cost are more likely to already have a nicer car with some of the features this unit would offer. It would be a waste of money to buy an expensive multi-purpose unit when I already have some of the functionalities without it.",300 - 399 USD,"""Online (e.g., Amazon/eBay)"",""Electronic Store (e.g., BestBuy)""",I would somewhat unlikely purchase it,"If my car already has the functionalities the product offers, whether its cheaper to buy a multi-purpose unit than separate products, the range of products working seamlessly together, wifi connectivity (especially for dashcam), added safety of having product, whether having the product would reduce my insurance premium.","Skoda Fabia, 2015","Nottingham, UK",Non-binary,20 - 25 years old,Civil service,"Less than $20,000",No,,

I thought I'd get over it eventually, nah fam.  I have looked into aftermarket HUD systems but I don't want something cheap that isn't worth it. 

My opinion: 
Design 2 HUD systems. 1 that is super economical, the other that is just as good, if not better than a BMW HUD system.  I would purchase the later system, it's the one feature I wish my car had.
You will know you have won when you see a BMW that came w/ HUD and they still went and installed your unit instead!

P.s. I'm kind of car guy so HUD is important to me, however I work for BMW sales and I can tell you my opinion on HUD is def the minority.  Most of my clients are totally okay without it. The clients who want it are always more performance minded drivers. Just my two Cents! Good luck in getting your product to market!","It will be smarter to market the dash cam and HUD as separate items, and/or offer a combo package with both HUD and dash cam together. Many drivers already have dashcams and don't need to pay for a second one and many newer cars come with warnings already. 

Also, do you want the liability of lawsuits if your frontal collision warning software malfunctions? Id consider the pros and cons and whether or not its worth it. 

Lastly, design a universal top cover for the unit housing, the sketches look great. However I would suggest designing a bottom piece that was more custom fit and colored to that vehicles particular year make and model will do a long way to making the unit look very seemless and OEM with the cars interior. No one wants a bulky lunch tray on their dash! 

P.s. I've always wanted there to be a really nice aftermarket HUD system available. I hope you guys succeed!",400 - 499 USD,"""Online (e.g., Amazon/eBay)"",""Electronic Store (e.g., BestBuy)""",I would very likely purchase it,"Fit and finish. 
I'll watch a review of it on YouTube. If the materials seem flimsy or the software is very rudimentary, or if the unit is just too bulky and distracting, then unfortuntely ill pass.  Unless it VERY cheap :P.
