Due to the frequency of changing conditions entering my field of view and areas I'm monitoring (pedestrians, potential pedestrians at each intersection, other cars changing lanes, animals, etc), I don't judge my speed using a speedometer, but a sense of how fast I'm moving. 

I'd love to pretend I can tell you how quickly objects wiz past me, but it's actually that I've come to learn my car. It's fairly easy even for a regular driver to learn the sound and feel of a car going a certain speed. It does have something to do with how fast things wiz past you, but only when in combination. 

I've observed both significant others, family members, and friends drive in the same manner.
